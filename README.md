# matlabstaircase

This is an implementation of a simple adaptive (up/down) staircase procedure (Levitt, 1971) for use in Matlab. It allows for interleaving of multiple staircases and has been designed to be as flexible as possible.

Any comments on the code itself are welcome and I do like to hear success stories (with or without credits) to get a view of which fields / disciplines / experiments this toolbox has been used for.

## Instructions for use
After downloading the toolbox, open the demo.m file -- it is fully commented and explains all options for use. Try running the demo for a simulation of data so you can check that it works.

##Can I cite you?
No need for citations. If you like it, drop me a line on lugtigheid@gmail.com to let me know! :)
